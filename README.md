# Feel Good Portfolio Revamp

_Working towards a cleaner, simpler, more minimalistic  profile with a hint of playfulness to it_

**Why?**    
My previous profile has been bugging it. It's not a good representation of who I am, my values, and what I've learned.

**Other**   
I'm using this as an opportunity to learn to use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

**Then what?**  
After the layout, content, and styling is in place, I'd like to add in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
